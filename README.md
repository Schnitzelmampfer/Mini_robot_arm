# Mini_robot_arm
My University-Project of programming a little robot arm.
It uses LabVIEW to control an Arduino microcontroller. The robot arm is built from 3D-printed parts and moved by four micro servos (design by [Build Some Stuff](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6142959)).\
The microcontroller is programed with C in Microchip Studio.\
Look at the LabVIEW block diagrams [here](FULLBLOCKDIAGRAM.md).
